# Mango Reader

The __Gleez Log__ component monitors your website, capturing system events in a log to be reviewed by an authorized individual at a later time. __Mango Reader__ provide access to read all System Logs with using [MongoDB DBMS](http://www.mongodb.org) *if you use ability to record logs to the database*.

[!!] This module has appeared thanks to such wonderful projects as [Wouterrr/MangoDB](https://github.com/Wouterrr/MangoDB) - MongoDB for KO 3.x and [colinmollenhour/mongodb-php-odm](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/mongodb-php-odm) - A simple but powerful set of wrappers for using MongoDb in PHP (also a Kohana 3 module)

## Overview

**MongoDB** (from "hu**mongo**us") is an open source document-oriented database system developed and supported by [10gen](http://www.10gen.com/). It is part of the NoSQL family of database systems. Instead of storing data in tables as is done in a "classical" relational database, MongoDB stores structured data as JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas (MongoDB calls the format BSON), making the integration of data in certain types of applications easier and faster.

## Description

**Mango Reader** is a [Gleez CMS](http://gleezcms.org/) module that provide access to read all system logs with using [MongoDB DBMS](http://www.mongodb.org). The log is simply a list of recorded events containing usage data, performance data, errors, warnings and operational information.

It is vital to check the log report on a regular basis as it is often the only way to tell what is going on.
